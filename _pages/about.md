I research language and cognition with a special interest in how individual difference in language experience augments our cognition. I am particularly interested in differences in inner speech, multilingualism, amd semantic distribution. 

I am currently a PhD Student at the University of Wisconsin - Madison working with Dr. Gary Lupyan in the [Lupyan Lab](http://sapir.psych.wisc.edu/).
